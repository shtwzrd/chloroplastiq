Chloroplastiq
-------------

L-System generator for creating and rendering trees.  

Currently the only supported renderer is an ugly old WinForms based one.

Project compiles just fine on Linux under Mono.


PLANS:

Revitalize project

	- Refactor (In Progress)

	- Use F# to parallelize generation -- old implementation is slow (In Progress)

	- Make a new Rendering backend: Use ASP.NET and render to an HTML5 Canvas
